## Projects

### [Stock Prediction Using Prophet](https://github.com/HarshMistry1/Data_science_projects/tree/master/Stock%20prediction%20using%20streamlit)
**Goal** :- *The main aim, to create this one is to visualize and forecasting of finance data more with more Ease and Faster.*
- In this project, we can analyze and forecast the data from Yahoo Finance.
- For forecasting purpose, we have used Prophet and for visualization purpose plotly has been used.
- Plotly allows us for interactive visualization and also many more functionality along with it.

### [Oxford Pet Image Segmentation Using Neural Network and U-Net](https://github.com/HarshMistry1/Data_science_projects/tree/master/Image%20Segmentation%20Using%20U-Net)
**Goal** :- *The intention to make this project is, mainly for medical image segmentation for MRI Images, Cancer related, To look for any spots in X-Rays and many more.*
- By this project, We can Create or find the Object or Animal and we can Mask them.
- For neural network, Tensorflow has been used and Pix2Pix Model has used for segmentation purpose.
- We have used customized U-Net model for sake of simplicity and it allows us manual modification.
- The accuracy scores nearly 96% but, somehow it requires fine-tuning to get better result.

### [Handwritten Digits Genration Using GAN](https://github.com/HarshMistry1/Data_science_projects/tree/master/Handwritten%20Digits%20Generation%20Using%20G.A.N)
**Goal** - *By making this project, the main goal was to acheive more accurate results to get better and random generated images to helping Photography industry, Medical Application, Detect the image real images to compare the generated results to find the right one.*
- GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) is very interesting and by using this project we can generate random digits by
- In GAN, There are main two components. The one is generator and the one is discriminator.
- We have made customised generator and discriminator using tensorflow.
- Here, we have only trained this model at 40 epochs However, For better results, it atleast requires 2000 Epochs.
